 * Root layout component that wraps all pages with consistent header and footer

 * layout component and includes Header and Footer components.
 *
 * To customize the header or footer, directly edit the Header.tsx and Footer.tsx files
 * in the layouts/parts directory.
 *
 * @param children - Child routes to render (typically <Outlet /> from react-router-dom)
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * <RootLayout>
 *   <Outlet />
 * </RootLayout>
 * ```
